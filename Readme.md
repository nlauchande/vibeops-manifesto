# The VibeOps Manifesto

## We Are Done Flying Blind

For too long, we've adopted AI coding tools based on feelings, not facts. We've traded short-term convenience for long-term chaos. We've accumulated technical debt while believing we're moving faster.

**No more.**

---

## Core Beliefs

### 1. Configuration Over Chaos
We define explicit rules for AI behavior. We don't hope our tools do the right thing—we configure them to do the right thing.

**We write it down. We make it explicit. We enforce it automatically.**

### 2. Tests Before Code
Humans define WHAT needs to happen. AI suggests HOW to implement it. Tests validate immediately.

**We never let AI define requirements. We never skip validation.**

### 3. Measure What Matters
We track objective metrics, not subjective feelings. We run benchmarks, not surveys. We compare configurations with data, not opinions.

**If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.**

### 4. Share What Works
We build in public. We share configurations that pass evals. We contribute to collective knowledge.

**Rising tides lift all boats. Your .cursorrules can save someone's production system.**

---

## What We Reject

❌ **"Just trust the AI"** → We validate everything

❌ **"It feels faster"** → We measure actual impact

❌ **"Everyone's doing it"** → We adopt deliberately, not desperately

❌ **"Best practices"** → We demand evidence-based practices

❌ **"Move fast and break things"** → We move fast and build things that work

---

## What We Build

✅ **Configuration-driven development** where AI tools operate within defined guardrails

✅ **Test-first workflows** where validation is automatic, not optional

✅ **Measurement frameworks** that reveal truth over perception

✅ **Community knowledge** where proven configurations are shared freely

✅ **Sustainable AI adoption** that improves code quality, not just velocity

## The VibeOps Developer

A VibeOps developer:

- **Writes .cursorrules before writing code** - Define the game before you play it
- **Creates tests before asking AI for implementation** - Validation first, generation second
- **Runs evals to measure impact** - Trust data, not dopamine
- **Shares configurations that work** - Lift others as you climb
- **Challenges false confidence** - Question the vibe, measure the outcome

---

## Our Principles

### Start With Why
Every AI tool adoption must answer: "What specific problem are we solving, and how will we know if it's working?"

### Make It Explicit
Configuration files over tribal knowledge. Written rules over implicit expectations. Automated checks over manual review.

### Validate Everything
AI generates, humans validate. Always. No exceptions.

### Measure in Production
What happens in real codebases with real developers matters more than lab results with toy problems.

### Iterate Based on Evidence
Change configurations based on eval results, not hunches. If the data says it's not working, change it.

## For Africa, By Developers, For the World

We have a unique opportunity:

**Learn from global mistakes without repeating them.**
Others flew blind. We won't.

**Build for our context.**
Load shedding, intermittent internet, resource constraints—our configurations reflect our reality.

**Lead the conversation.**
We're not just adopting AI tools. We're defining how to adopt them responsibly.

**Share our innovations.**
African VibeOps configurations can improve codebases worldwide.

---

## The VibeOps Commitment

I commit to:

1. **Configure before I code** - Define AI behavior explicitly
2. **Test before I trust** - Write tests, then ask AI for implementation
3. **Measure what matters** - Run VibeOps Evals on my configurations
4. **Share what works** - Contribute configurations that pass evaluations
5. **Challenge the hype** - Ask "where's the data?" when claims sound too good

---

## This Is Not Anti-AI

We're not against AI coding tools. We're against **irresponsible AI coding adoption**.

AI tools are powerful. That's exactly why we need systematic approaches to use them well.

VibeOps doesn't slow you down—it ensures you're actually speeding up in reality, not just perception.

---

## Join the Movement

**Start measuring. Stop guessing.**

- GitHub: github.com/[username]/vibeops
- Share your .cursorrules with #VibeOps
- Run VibeOps Evals and post your scores
- Contribute to the eval suite
- Help build configurations for your context

---

## The Bottom Line

**Vibe coding is chaos.**

**VibeOps is systematic.**

**Feelings lie.**

**Data doesn't.**

**Configuration beats hope.**

**Tests catch what vibes miss.**

**Measurement reveals truth.**

**We build responsibly or we build technical debt.**

---

## Version 1.0

This manifesto will evolve. Just like our configurations, we'll iterate based on evidence from the community.

Fork it. Improve it. Share it.

**Let's build AI-assisted development that actually works.**
